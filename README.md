Hello there, I am learning react js and building some interesting projects using react js.

This project(Google-keep-app-clone) I have made using react is very simple and made with the help of react Hooks, spread operator, and the main thing in this project is that it is a components based project.

You all are familiar with the google keep app, in which you are writing the things that you have to complete in the future or in the future time.

All about this project is this is a clone of google keep app. in which you can create notes, add notes and delete the notes.

It is very simple and interesting project I have ever built.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
